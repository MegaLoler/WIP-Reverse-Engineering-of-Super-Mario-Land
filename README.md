this is just a personal WIP project to reverse engineer Super Mario Land for learning purposes

its my first time reverse engineering any kind of software, so dun look at me!

nothing is organized right now and i only half have an idea of what most things are

the code is riddled with erratic comments detailing my erratic thought processes :p

`locations.i` is where i put memory locations i think i've figured out

`music_.asm` is an experimental repogramming of the main overworld music

`reassemble.sh` is a cheap script to reassemble the .asm using wla-gb
